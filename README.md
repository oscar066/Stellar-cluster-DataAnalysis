# Stellar Cluster Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of stellar clusters using data from astronomical observations, specifically the NGC 2516 and M13 clusters. The goal is to estimate the age of each cluster, compare the results with isochrones, and explore the properties of the cluster stars.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into sections corresponding to each cluster:

### 1. Hyades Cluster Analysis (Sample Section)
- Read data for the Hyades cluster.
- Plot star locations in Right Ascension and Declination.
- Analyze parallax distributions and proper motions.
- Select cluster members based on parallax and proper motion criteria.
- Calculate the mean cluster distance and its uncertainty.
- Generate Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) and compare with isochrones.

### 2. NGC 2516 Cluster Analysis
- Read data for the NGC 2516 cluster.
- Plot star locations in Right Ascension and Declination.
- Analyze parallax distributions and proper motions.
- Select cluster members based on parallax and proper motion criteria.
- Calculate the mean cluster distance and its uncertainty.
- Generate Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) and compare with isochrones.

### 3. M13 Cluster Analysis
- Read data for the M13 cluster.
- Plot star locations in Right Ascension and Declination.
- Analyze parallax distributions and proper motions.
- Select cluster members based on parallax and proper motion criteria.
- Calculate the mean cluster distance and its uncertainty.
- Generate Color-Magnitude Diagram (CMD) and compare with isochrones.

## Results and Findings
- Summarize key findings for each cluster.
- Compare estimated cluster ages with accepted values.
- Discuss discrepancies and potential sources of error.

## Dependencies
- Python (version 3.10.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- seaborn
